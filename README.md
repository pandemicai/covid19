You can edit JSON with this online editor https://json-csv.com/editor
You can also convert JSON to CSV at https://json-csv.com. Then you can edit the file in Excel. Once you are done, you can convert the CSV back to JSON at https://json-csv.com/reverse
Try it.

I recommend Visual Code Studio as the editor. It is free. You can download a copy from here:
https://code.visualstudio.com/

Important things:
- You can not have doule quotes "" in Json key, value pairs. Replace the double quotes with a single quote.
- You can not break json string into multiple lines.
- Using https://jsonlint.com/ JSON validator to validate the json files.
