Important things:
- You can not have doule quotes "" in Json key/value pairs. Replace the double quotes with a single quote.
- You can not break json string into multiple lines.
- Using https://jsonlint.com/ JSON validator to validate the json files.
- Don't introduce new key/value pairs. Don't delete existing keys/value pairs.
- You can update the values in each row of the JSON files, add and delete rows
- Each row needs to end with a comma ",", except for the last row

For live update, make sure the rows are sorted by number of confirmed cases, and update the URL reference for the new reported cases (google search for the link, no website with a paywall. Trusted source only, take a look existing JSON file for commonly used sources)
