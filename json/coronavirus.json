A man in his 80s from northern Taiwan and his 50-year-old son were identified as, respectively, the 27th and 28th cases of the viral infection. The source of infection is still under investigation, as the father and son have not traveled overseas recently. However, the CECC said another son of the man in his 80s frequently visited China, including Wuhan City, but he returned to Taiwan on Dec. 2, from the Chinese city of Guangzhou. The younger son of the 27th case met with friends who had also visited China, during the Lunar New Year holiday. The 80-year-old father, who suffers from diabetes and has high blood pressure, started coughing and sneezing on Feb. 6, after which he was diagnosed as having pneumonia and treated at a single ward on Feb. 9. The man was transferred to intensive care on Feb. 16 after suffering severe respiratory distress. Later, he was moved to a negative pressure isolation ward on Feb. 20 as  his physician suspected the man of having contracted tuberculosis. The next day, the hospital decided to test him for the coronavirus. His infection was confirmed on Sunday. The 28th patient, who lives with his father (27th case), had a fever, running nose, and sore throat on Jan. 31. He was diagnosed with pneumonia on Feb. 8 by the emergency clinic after having a persistent fever. The man went to the clinic on Feb. 11 and 18, and it was not until Feb. 21 that he was isolated in the hospital and tested for the virus. The CECC has begun isolating and testing a total of 115 medical staffers that had close contact with the infected individuals.",

Three of the four coronavirus deaths were from Daenam Hospital in the southeastern city of Cheongdo, where the country's first COVID-19 fatality took place and more than 110 people, including nine medical staff, were found to be infected. The number of COVID-19 infections more than doubled in a single day on Saturday, with most cases centered around a religious organization in the country's fourth-largest city of Daegu and the neighboring Daenam Hospital. Of the 123 new cases, 75 are related to worship services of the Shincheonji church in the southeastern city of Daegu. The infected cases that can be traced to the church services hovered above 300 as of Sunday morning, accounting for more than half of the total cases here. The KCDC said it has placed more than 9,000 Shincheonji members in self-quarantine. Some 90 new cases were in Daegu, which has a population of roughly 2.5 million, with 20 new virus incidents reported in the surrounding North Gyeongsang Province. Gwangju and Jeju also reported one more case each, while the southern port city of Busan reported two more patients, in a sign that the virus may spread quickly nationwide. The number of people being checked for the virus and under quarantine came to 6,039, it added. The country has tested a total of 22,633 suspected cases, with 16,038 testing negative. South Korea confirmed its first new coronavirus case from a Chinese woman from Wuhan, the epicenter of the virus outbreak, on Jan. 20. The country's 31st patient, a probable 'super spreader', had attended Shincheonji's worship services in Daegu.",

That patient was a 38-year-old man, who fell ill after meeting a friend who had visited China. His condition has stabilized. All those who have tested positive are people who on February 18-19 had contacts with the emergency room and the hospital of Codogno. 259 people had been screened in the area in the past two days and 35 had tested positive.",
